# Shapes!

The goal of this assignment is to understand inheritance in javascript.

## Steps

1. Look at the source files for shape.js, square.js, rectangle.js. The shape.js file will have all the functions that need to be implemented. Do not write code yet!
2. Write your tests first.  Implement tests for shape, square and rectangle.
3. Once your tests are written, start implementing the functions in shape, square and rectangle.
  * Square and rectangle should inherit from shape.
  * The getRGB function should only be written once.
